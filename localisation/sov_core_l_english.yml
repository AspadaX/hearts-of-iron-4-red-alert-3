 ussr.1.t:0 "Soviet Ultimatum"
 ussr.1.d:0 "The Soviet Union have demanded that we hand over large parts of our country to them immediately or face an invasion.\n\nGiven that the land they're demanding is full of Oil we should probably stand our ground, but what chance do we stand against the Soviet giant?"
 ussr.1.a:0 "Submit..."
 ussr.1.b:0 "Honor in Death!"
 ussr.2.t:0 "Iran Resists"
 ussr.2.d:0 "The Iranian government has decided to resist our demands and have therefore chosen the total destruction of their nation.\n\nWe must stop at nothing until Iran's oil supply is firmly under our control."
 ussr.2.a:0 "Wipe them out!"
 ussr.3.t:0 "Iran Submits"
 ussr.3.d:0 "The Iranian government has wisely chosen to hand over the states that we demanded and in the process given us control over most of their Oil supply.\n\nWith the new supply of Oil under our control we can continue our goal of wiping out the Allies."
 ussr.3.a:0 "Oil!"
 ussr.4.t:0 "Leadership Changes"
 ussr.4.d:0 "Now that our we've almost beat the Allies its time to ensure that our occupied territories remain in good hands.\n\nBy changing the leadership of these nations we can ensure that any potential revolts from our officers are spotted."
 ussr.4.a:0 "Time to shake things up!"
 ussr.5.t:0 "Leadership in Europe"
 ussr.5.d:0 "The most important place we should consider stronger leadership is in the Allied occupied territories of Europe.\n\nThe war hero Nikolai Krukov is sure to be the man to stamp out any resistance that might be festering in the Allied states."
 ussr.5.a:0 "Krukov is the man for the job."
 ussr.5.b:0 "Oleg is doing fine."
 ussr.6.t:0 "Leadership in Scandinavia"
 ussr.6.d:0 "Another area of potential revolt is the newly conquered states of Scandinavia. Although less of a priority than the European states it is no doubt a potential target for Allied subversive activities.\n\n Leadership changes here might help to quell any rebellious intent."
 ussr.6.a:0 "Zhana will keep them in line."
 ussr.6.b:0 "Dasha will stay."
 ussr.7.t:0 "Cuban Leadership"
 ussr.7.d:0 "Our most ruthless black ops agent, Natasha, has been leading the Cubans in preparation for our inevitable invasion of the United States of America.\n\nPerhaps her skills could be better utilised in finishing off the Allies in Europe."
 ussr.7.a:0 "She will lead our Glorious armies."
 ussr.7.b:0 "Natasha stays in Cuba."
